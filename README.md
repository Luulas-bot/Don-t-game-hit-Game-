# Don-t-get-hit-Game
A real simple game about a spaceship which can't touch the asteorids incoming, or it will get destroyed and "Game Over".

------------------------------------------------TRY IT OUT-------------------------------------------------------

How to download and play the game?

1- You have to download the whole folder. To do this, click on the green button that have a "down arrow" + "code". After that, click on "Download ZIP".

2- Put the ZIP file that you have just downloaded in whatever folder in your computer you like.

3- Right click on the zip folder and choose the option "Extract here". It will generate a folder with the same name as the .ZIP file.

4- Once inside that folder, there will be 2 more ZIP files that you have to extract. Use the same method as before with the "extract here" button. Once the files are extracted, DELETE the ZIP files and stay with the folder ones.

VERY IMPORTANT: USE THE "EXTRACT HERE" BUTTON AND ONLY THAT ONE. IF NOT IT WILL GENERATE OVERLAPPING FOLDERS THAT MAY CAUSE ISSUES.

5- Once everything is done, doble-click on the .EXE file and the game should work just fine. ENJOY IT.

This is my first game and it was done to introduce myself into programming and start learning about python and pygame.

Any errors you have, most importantly, about the download/set-up part, please send me a messagge about it. Thank you.
