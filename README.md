# Don't get hit
### About this game
This is a real simple game, with some real simple mechanics. This is the first project I ever made programming. I decided it would be funny and easy to do a simple game about a spaceship, which cannot hit the asteroids incoming.

### The language
The game is written on python. It uses the module pygame, which is a great module for games. The reason it is written on python and not on any other language is beacuse it is what I learned first. 

### How can I play the game?

- First you gotta create an envoirment with all the requirments. You can find these in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Then, once the env is set up, you have to download the scripts + the images. You can do this using the green button on the top right part, which says `code`.
- This will download you a `.zip` file which you have to drag into the folder where you created the env.
- Once that is done, you have to right-click the `.zip` file and extract everything from it.
- Then using your favorite **IDE**, enter into `main.py` and compile it and run it.

### Some things to tell
The game may have some bugs due to the fact that is my first ever project. If you find one you can either do a pull request making a solution to it, or you can just e-mail me telling what the bug is about and then I will fix it.
The game is not really well programmed but anyways, I don't want to correct or simplify or even clean the project because i feel it has more value to just stay the way it is.

# Enjoy!
